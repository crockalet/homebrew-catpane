  caveats <<~EOS
    CatPane needs platform-specific tools at runtime:

    For Android capture, install adb:
      brew install --cask android-platform-tools

    For physical iOS device capture, install libimobiledevice:
      brew install libimobiledevice

    iOS simulator capture works out of the box with Xcode installed.

    A `catpane` CLI symlink is added to your PATH, so you can run the MCP server with:
      catpane mcp
